Added a Websocket Handler to /socket

Idea

Have the web interface handlers update some global variables in the main python script:
[DEVICE1, 1; DEVICE2, 0; DEVICE3, 0] for example

Have the socket client (the ESP8266) send a message to the socket of it's name; DEVICE1, DEVICE 2 etc.
The socket handler can then check the variable for the device name and return the value for it; 1 or 0.

The client can the use this to trigger the relative pin for the relay, 1 being on and 0 being off.


Could be further expanded to allo more variable data to be kept:

DeviceName, VariableName, Value

MainReceiver, Relay1, 1
MainReceiver, Relay2, 1
SubReceiver, Relay 1, 0

etc
